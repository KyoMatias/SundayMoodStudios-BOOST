  Eyecatch: Meet Hitomi
  Description: Hitomi Nakazato is a 19-year-old novice street racer, car tuner, and
    a member of the V&B crew, as well as Ken's girlfriend. She is passionate about
    cars, hardworking, patient, resourceful, tactical, and dangerous when needed.
    Hitomi has brown, feathered bob hair, hazel eyes, and a light makeup look with
    pale rose lips. She is often seen wearing a purple headband, pale crimson thick-framed
    glasses, a cropped leather jacket, and an olive green round-neck shirt, paired
    with a high-waisted black skirt, thigh-high socks, and green Converse shoes.
    Her outgoing and jolly personality shines through, and she always exudes confidence.
