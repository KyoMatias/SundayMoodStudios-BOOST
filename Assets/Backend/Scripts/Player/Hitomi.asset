  P_Description: "-Growing up from a broken family that consists of an alcoholic
    mother, a missing father, and a gang influenced older brother, Hitomi was tired
    of her atmosphere as she felt like every one was a black sheep. \r\n\r\n-After
    meeting her only best friend back in junior high, Hitomi and Rinoa was inseperable.
    Until Rinoa changed and started to hangout with a frat/gang group. This ended
    the friendship of the two with a brutal ending. \r\n\r\n-Before she graduated,
    She met Ken Sakamoto while walking home from school and soon was drop-dead in
    love with the guy. They found themselves dating and Hitomi moved out of her household
    to live with him. Ken was also a car geek like Hitomi, but Ken was an experienced
    street racer. He invited her to his workshop where he worked on his vehicles,
    there Hitomi met Nica Murasaki and Yuzuki Tsuchiya, Ken's College friends. they
    soon worked around the workshop and Ken even gifted Hitomi one of his stock cars.
    A black 1994 Mk4 Toyota Supra which Hitomi would later paint Olive green. Ken
    decided to group them in a crew and named themselves V&B (Vrooms and Braps)."
